    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used
      for describing the presentation of a document written in
      a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone
      technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
      content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
      This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
      more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics,enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
      .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
      structural content as well as enabling the .css file to
      be cached to improve the page load speed between
      the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
