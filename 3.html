    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS,
      is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
      specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often
      just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
      technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript enables
      interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
      applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
      client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have
      a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
